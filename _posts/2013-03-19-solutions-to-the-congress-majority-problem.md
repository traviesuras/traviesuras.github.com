# The congress majority problem

This problem was presented to some students at the IFSC-USP training
to take part in programming contests. It consists in, given a set of
parties and their number of representatives in the congress, to
compute all possible subsets of parties that have majority.

The description of the problem (in Portuguese) can be found
[here](http://basalto.ifsc.usp.br/~gonzalo/a1.pdf).

# The solutions

We included two solutions for this problem in the GitHub repository
[traviesuras/maratona-ifsc](https://github.com/traviesuras/maratona-ifsc). One
uses recursion, while the other is iteractive.

A short explanation of the solutions (in Portuguese) can be found
[here](http://basalto.ifsc.usp.br/~gonzalo/a1-solution.pdf).
